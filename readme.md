## Get started locally

See **[`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md)** for the
authoritative setup runbook (prerequisites, Docker stack, `appsettings.local.json`,
running tests, troubleshooting). Goal is `git clone` → green integration
tests in under 10 minutes.

Quick version once your toolchain is installed:

```pwsh
pwsh ./scripts/check-prereqs.ps1
pwsh ./scripts/dev-up.ps1
cd src/Api; func start --useHttps      # in one terminal
cd src/Client; npm run dev             # in another
dotnet test tests/IntegrationTests     # in a third
```
